# Grade Calculator

## Overview

The Grade Calculator is a web-based tool that allows students to calculate the grades they need on their future assessments to achieve their desired overall course grade. It supports the input of both exact scores for assessments that have been completed and a range of expected scores for assessments that are still pending.

## Features

- **Exact Score Entry**: Users can enter the score they have already achieved for an assessment.
- **Score Range Entry**: Users can specify a range of potential scores for upcoming assessments to account for uncertainty.
- **Dynamic Calculations**: Based on the input provided, the calculator dynamically computes the required score for remaining assessments.
- **Activity Management**: Users can add new activities, and remove them as needed.

## How to Use

1. Choose whether to enter an 'Exact Score' or a 'Score Range' for the assessment.
2. For an 'Exact Score', input the score you received.
3. For a 'Score Range', provide the minimum and maximum expected scores.
4. Input the weight of the assessment as a percentage of your final grade.
5. Click 'Add Activity' to include the assessment in your calculations.
6. Use the 'Delete' button next to any activity to remove it from your list.
7. After adding all relevant activities, enter the desired final grade percentage.
8. Press 'Calculate' to determine the score needed on the remaining assessments to achieve your goal.
